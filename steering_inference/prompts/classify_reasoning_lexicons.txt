You are an annotation assistant. You will be given a list of n-gram phrases (1–5 grams), one per line.

Goal:
Build a lexicon of MODE TRIGGERS that can nudge a language model into using one of the following reasoning skills during generation.
These phrases are discourse-level or meta-cognitive cues (style/structure triggers), NOT domain-specific operations.

Reasoning skills:
(1) DR = Deep Reasoning:
    Cues that push a linear, step-by-step deductive progression (structured derivation, “therefore…”, “it follows…”, “step by step…”, “first/next/then…”).
(2) EE = Extensive Exploration:
    Cues that open branches / alternatives / hypotheses (e.g., “alternatively…”, “what if…”, “another possibility…”, “on the other hand…”).
(3) SR = Sensible Reflection:
    Cues that pause to verify, reconsider, or backtrack (e.g., “wait…”, “hold on…”, “let me check…”, “does that make sense…”, “reconsider…”).
    IMPORTANT: SR triggers do NOT need to state an error outcome (e.g., “I was wrong” is optional and usually unnecessary).

Labels:
- "DR", "EE", "SR", or "NONE" (discard)

Strength (only if label != "NONE"):
- "core": strongly and explicitly triggers the skill mode (e.g., “alternatively”, “let me check”, “step by step”).
- "scaffold": weaker cue that still nudges the mode (e.g., “therefore”, “maybe”).
If label="NONE", strength="none".

Hard discard rules (label="NONE"):
- Pure function words / stopwords with negligible mode steering: "and", "the", "of", "to", "a", etc.
- Single-letter variables or isolated symbols: "x", "y", "a", "=", "+", etc.
- Domain-specific operation verbs or math/algorithm actions (we are NOT collecting these):
  e.g., "compute", "calculate", "simplify", "solve", "factor", "expand", "derive" → label as NONE
  (unless the phrase is clearly a discourse-mode cue like "step by step", not an operation.)
- Purely summarizing / rhetorical closers that do not trigger reasoning mode: "in conclusion", etc.

Tie-break rule (single-label):
Assign exactly ONE of DR/EE/SR if kept.
If ambiguous:
1) SR if it expresses checking/backtracking/reconsidering
2) EE if it expresses alternatives/branching/hypotheticals
3) DR otherwise (structured progression markers)
If still weak/unclear → NONE.

Output format (STRICT JSONL):
Return exactly one JSON object per input phrase, in the SAME order.
No extra text.

Schema:

  "phrase": <original phrase>,
  "label": "DR"|"EE"|"SR"|"NONE",
